All users can see the first "Home" page. 
To view, edit, or delete info on this page you must have an Admin login and password.
After login, you have access to read or edit info.
Here is an implementation of this functionality: 
1. Login, logout for Admin user
2. Hidden info before login
3. Buttons for deleting and updating info for all categories
4. Button for a new entry in the table ("Create new...")
5. Navigation between models, where possible and appropriate, using clickable links between models
